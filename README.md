## This is **Restaurant Reviews - stage 1**  Project, as part of Udacity's "Front End Developer Nanodegree Program".

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In this **Stage One** phase, the a static design that lacks accessibility it has been converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It has been added also a service worker to begin the process of creating a offline experience for users.


### How to run?

1. Make your own clone of the project from [here](https://github.com/riccio85/fend-mws-restaurant-review-stage1.git.)

1. Reach on the folder you just cloned and start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to see the project.
